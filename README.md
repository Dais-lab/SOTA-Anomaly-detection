This repository is a Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection toolkit contains state-of-the-art methods with a unified and easy-to-use interface.

Multivariate time series are a group of inherently correlated time series. For example, in the area of manufacturing industry and Information Technology (IT) systems, an entity (e.g., a physical machine or software service) is generally equipped with a monitoring mechanism to ensure its security or reliability.

In contrast to anomaly detection on single time series, extensive recent studies indicate that dependency hidden in MTS is of great importance for accurate anomaly detection, namely, the anomaly detector should consider the MTS as a whole. To this end, state-of-the-art methods have resort to deep learning-based methods to capture the dependency for more accurate anomaly detection.
